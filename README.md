# Computer-Vision_Rock-Paper-Scissors
Play Rock Paper Scissors with Yourself with the help of Neural Networks.

# Requirements and Dependencies
`Ubuntu 20.04` OS.
`Python 3.8`.

The following libraries/frameworks are required:

1. `OpenCV`
2. `TensorFlow`
3. `Keres`


# Teachable Machine
This application makes use of [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/), an easy way to make machine learning models.
There are three required steps:

1. Gather and group your data into classes or categories, that you want the computer to learn. These are images or audio signals.
2. Train your model, then instantly test it out to see whether it can correctly classify new examples.
3. Download the model. This will be a `.h5` file which will need extracting.


# Model Verification Check
Once you have a your`.h5` file,`modelRunCheck.py` can be used to verify that the model loads sucessfully. 

# Rock Paper Scissors Base Code
Run `RPS_Base_Code.py` to play against the computer; proof of concept.
